//MULTITHREADING CONTINUED
//Deadlock
//A deadlock occurs in concurrent programming when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
//This typically happens when threads hold locks on resources and request additional locks held by other threads.
//For example, Thread A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2, while Thread B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1. Since neither thread can proceed, they remain stuck in a deadlock state.
// Deadlock happen when 4 conditions are met:
//1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access a resource at a time
//2. Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other thread.
//3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be released unless the process holding them terminates.
//4. Circular Wait: There is a chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

//Thread Safty
// a thread is safe when multiple threadas are trying to access a resource and unexpected results or race conditions do not occur.
// There are four ways to achieve Thread Safety in Java. These are: Synchronization ,Volatile Keyword ,Atomic Variable, Final Keyword

//Lamda Expressions
// A lambda expression is a short-cut way to write anonymous methods (functions) in Java.
// Itâ€™s used mainly to implement interfaces with a single abstract method (called functional interfaces).

    void sayHello();
}
Greeting g = new Greeting() { //without lambda expression

Greeting g = () -> System.out.println("Hello!"); //with lambda expression

//Thread Pooling
//Thread Pooling is a technique where a group of worker threads are created in advance and reused to execute multiple tasks.
// Instead of creating a new thread every time (which is costly), we borrow a thread from the pool, use it, and return it.
// ðŸ”¹ Why use Thread Pooling?
// âœ… Better performance
// âœ… Avoid overhead of thread creation/destruction
// âœ… Avoid running out of system resources
// âœ… Helps manage concurrency efficiently
