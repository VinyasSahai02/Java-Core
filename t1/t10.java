//Exceutors Framework
//used to create thread pools
// Introduced in Java 5 as part of the java.util.concurrent package to simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the complexities involved in creating and managing threads.
// It will help in- Avoiding Manual Thread management, Resource management, Scalability, Thread reuse, Error handling
// ðŸ”¹ Core Components of Executors Framework
// Executor -> The base interface â€” runs submitted tasks
// ExecutorService -> Subinterface â€” adds methods for managing lifecycle and task results
// ScheduledExecutorService -> Executes tasks after a delay or periodically
// Executors -> A utility class to create executor services
